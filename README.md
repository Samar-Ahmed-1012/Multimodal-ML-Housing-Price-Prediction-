📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how combining computer vision (house images) with traditional tabular data can significantly improve housing price prediction accuracy compared to using tabular data alone.

🚀 Key Features
-- Multimodal Architecture: Combines CNN for image processing and Dense networks for tabular data
-- Synthetic Image Generation: Creates realistic house images based on housing features
-- Performance Comparison: Compares multimodal vs tabular-only approaches
-- Comprehensive Evaluation: Uses MAE and RMSE metrics for model assessment
-- Google Colab Ready: Fully executable in Google Colab environment

🏗️ Model Architecture
Multimodal Model Components:

Image Branch:
1. Base Model: VGG16 (pretrained on ImageNet)
2. Feature Extraction: Global Average Pooling + Dense layers
3. Output: 32-dimensional image features

Tabular Branch:
1. Input: 8 housing features (MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, etc.)
2. Processing: Dense layers with Batch Normalization and Dropout
3. Output: 16-dimensional tabular features
4. Fusion & Prediction:
5. Feature Concatenation: Combines image and tabular features
6. Final Layers: Dense layers for price regression
7. Output: Single continuous value (house price)

📊 Dataset
Source: California Housing Prices dataset
Samples: 500 houses (for demonstration)

Features:
1. MedInc: Median income
2. HouseAge: House age
3. AveRooms: Average rooms
4. AveBedrms: Average bedrooms
5. Population: Area population
6. AveOccup: Average occupancy
7. Latitude/Longitude: Geographic coordinates
Target: House Price (in USD)
